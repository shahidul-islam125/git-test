Node Js environment setup step by step:

*Open vs code editor and go to project folder by using terminal
*To create package.JSON file, run the below command
	npm init -y

*To install yarn package manager, run below command
	npm install -g yarn

*when we need to install any package then we use yarn package manager instead npm
*When we deliver our codebase to client after finishing task, we need to delicer npm or yarn lock
file and package.JSON file. As we are not send node module folder due to contain huge memory.
thats why we need to send only both file.

*Package.Json : contains the dependencies section, that contains dependable module or package link
or resource.

*npm package/yarn.lock file: This file contains some function that protect to update or change version \
of that module or package. Other this file, code base will destroy or make more bug due to update
package version.

//Solution: After getting code base just open terminal and run below command:
	npm i
this command run and autometically generating those package that are contains package.json file
dependencies section.
